    Wouldn't it be cool to predict the ratings for the restaurants you
    haven't visitied before?

# Motivation

This work is motivated by two notions:

1. How can we categorize the restaurants in a particular region into
   multiple groups, such as Southside restaurants?
2. How can we predict the ratings of restaurants that we haven't
   visited before? This would assist us in selecting restaurants that
   are likely to be enjoyable for us the next time we fancy going out.

# Implementation


Two approaches are employed in this work to address the aforementioned
questions:

1. Unsupervised learning: This approach is used to group restaurants
   that are in close proximity to each other.

2. Supervised learning: This approach is utilized to predict the
   ratings of new restaurants based on the ratings of previously
   visited restaurants.

# Final result


## Clustering restaurants

The following is a visualization of the Voronoi diagram generated by
the implemented unsupervised k-means algorithm. This diagram
illustrates the closest restaurants to each other, allowing us to
cluster them into eight groups.

## Rating prediction

The following demonstrates the implementation of least-squares linear
regression to predict user ratings for restaurants the user hasn't
visited before. This prediction is based on the ratings the user has
given to restaurants they have visited previously. The ratings are
indicated by the numbers inside parentheses above each colored dot.
