# Introduction

Pacman is in a maze world and would like to find a way out of the
labyrinth. There are several different search strategies that Pacman
could employ to reach its goal. These strategies include:

* Depth First Search
* Breadth First Search
* Uniform Cost Search
* A* Search

# Final result

## DFS

The following demonstrates Pacman using DFS to find its way out. The
intensity of red in the path indicates the number of times that path
has been considered by Pacman to determine the way out.
