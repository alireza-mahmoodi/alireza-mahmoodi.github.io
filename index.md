Ever since I realized that I'm drown to computers, I prioritized to
educate myself in various branches and fields of this extraordinary
invention. Software engineering, databases, creating websites,
computer networks, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning etc. all
ring a bell to my ears. I have always enjoyed learning new things
about computers, I still do enjoy as of today that I'm writing. My
enthusiasm and pleasure for learning and elevating my level of
knowledge hasn't changed over all these years as I constantly seek to
push the knowledge barriers and boundaries by leaning new tools and
skills and applying the knowledge of already learnt ones into real
practice. 


This portfolio webpage has been provided for your convenience to

publications and any other related materials that I have worked on over these years.
